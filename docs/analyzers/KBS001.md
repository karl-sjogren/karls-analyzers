# KBS001: Identifiers and comments should not contain impolite or degrading words or sentences

| Property | Value             |
| -------- | ----------------- |
| Id       | KBS001            |
| Category | BannedStrings     |
| Severity | Information       |
| Code fix | Yes               |

## Example

### Code with Diagnostic

```csharp
public class MyClass {
    private string _myString = "DoNotUseMe";
}
```

### Code with Fix

```csharp
public class MyClass {
    private string _myString = Constants.UseThisInstead;
}
```

## Remarks

To configure your strings and replacements add a file in the format `BannedStrings.txt` or `BannedStrings.*.txt` and then reference it in your csproj file as follows.

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <AdditionalFiles Include="BannedStrings.txt" />
  <AdditionalFiles Include="BannedStrings.Others.txt" />
</ItemGroup>
```

The contents of the file should have a list of disallowed strings and their replacements separated by semicolon, one per line.

```plaintext
DoNotUseMe;Constants.UseThisInstead
```
