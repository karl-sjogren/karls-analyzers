| Property | Value             |
| -------- | ----------------- |
| Id       | KO0001            |
| Category | BePolite          |
| Severity | Information       |

## Example

### Code with Diagnostic

```csharp
public class StupidComponent {
}
```

### Code with Fix

```csharp
public class NiceComponent {
}
```

## Remarks

The default terms can be seen in [PoliteCodeAnalyzer.cs](/src/Karls.Analyzers/BePolite/PoliteCodeAnalyzer.cs#L9),
the terms can also be configured using your own terms.

To configure your own terms add a file in the format `PoliteCode.txt` or `PoliteCode.*.txt` and then reference it
in your csproj file as follows.

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <AdditionalFiles Include="PoliteCode.txt" />
  <AdditionalFiles Include="PoliteCode.Swedish.txt" />
</ItemGroup>
```

The contents of the file should have a list of disallowed words, one per line.
