# KO0001: Properties on content types should have matching sort and source order

| Property | Value             |
| -------- | ----------------- |
| Id       | MD0001            |
| Category | Maintainability   |
| Severity | Information       |

## Example

### Code with Diagnostic

```csharp
[ContentType]
public class Block {
    [Display(Order = 2)]
    public virtual string Prop2 { get; set; }

    [Display(Order = 1)]
    public virtual string Prop1 { get; set; }
}
```

### Code with Fix

```csharp
[ContentType]
public class Block {
    [Display(Order = 1)]
    public virtual string Prop1 { get; set; }

    [Display(Order = 2)]
    public virtual string Prop2 { get; set; }
}
```

## Remarks
Will only analyze classes with an attribute named "ContentType".

Will emit a diagnostic for the following since the properties are not ordered in the
source as they are with the `DisplayAttribute`
